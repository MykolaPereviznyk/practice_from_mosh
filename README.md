Hi! Here are my practical exercises from Mosh’s course.

1. Currency_Converter
   Simple Python program to convert amounts between USD, EUR, and CAD using fixed exchange rates.
   How it works:
   - User enters an amount.
   - Chooses source and target currencies.
   - Program prints the converted value.
   Example:
   - Enter the amount: 100
   - Source currency (USD/EUR/CAD): USD
   - Target currency (USD/EUR/CAD): EUR
   - 100.00 USD is equal to 85.00 EUR
